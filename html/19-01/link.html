<! links.... if when we click a link if it directs to our system site then it is relative link(if the files linked within our system)
if the link redirects to another link is called absoulte link(the files located in another system or place)>
<! if we want to create links we have to use "anchor" tag and "hypertext reference" anchor is used to place for link and href is used when that link is clicked then the link belongs to that website.a tag is nothing but when we use href it provides underlined which is linked and we have to provide the link of other page when clicked >
<! this will redirect in same tab. if you want to open link within other page we use "target" and in this target we have values like "blank"---"_blank" is used for to open on another tab...and" _self" is used for with same page it redirects>
