<!images are used for to convey best we use images. rather than text>
<!for displaying a image we can use """img""" tag and """it is a self closing tag"""
*img content closing*
in below we used src. src is a attribute where it is a source and we can set height and widht also by using height=value and widht= value>
<! we can  put image by simply copying the link of that image address from chrome. and another way
we can use by internal storage by proving the storage location of directory and root file etc...,>
<!if we provided link has any problem. if it is working when we delivery but the link is deactivated others are wont able to see what
error is so for that we have "alt" alt is nothing but alternative it is simply like a message to pass information.. if image is correct alternative
wont apply or we cannot see that in webpage>

<! if we give the image from where the html is stored then it wont be a big problem it can be easily accesible and we can give the name>
